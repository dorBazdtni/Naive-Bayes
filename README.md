# Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation in Python

## <u>Introduction </u>

Welcome to the README for the "Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation in Python" project. This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to implement the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm in Python for classification tasks. Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks, especially when dealing with continuous data.

## <u> Project Overview </u>
<u> Introduction to Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): </u> We will start by providing a brief introduction to the GNB algorithm, explaining its underlying principles, and discussing scenarios where it is most suitable.

<u>Python Implementation:</u> We will walk you through the step-by-step implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm using Python. You'll learn how to preprocess data, calculate class priors, mean, and standard deviation for each feature, and make predictions using GNB.

<u> Model Evaluation: </u> We will cover various metrics for evaluating the performance of your GNB classifier, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

## <u> Conclusion </u>

This project aims to provide a clear and practical guide to implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes in Python. By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of the GNB algorithm and be able to apply it to classification tasks in your own machine learning projects.
